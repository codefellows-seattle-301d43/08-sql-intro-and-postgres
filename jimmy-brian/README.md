This lab teaches us to use PostgreSQL to store and query articles.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. Copy starter code
2. Make their own folder
3. Install PostgreSQL
4. Fill in SQL commands

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
HTML, Javascript, CSS, SQL

## Change Log
