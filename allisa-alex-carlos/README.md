This is a blog platform that displays blog data and allows users to create new blog entries that the app will format for easy insertion into the JSON file.

Getting Started
To run this, you will want to run npm install from the allisa-alex-carlos folder. Once your dependancies are installed, run the server.js and view the app in your browser.

Architecture
This app runs on Node.js, Express, and Postgresql on the backend. The front end uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Handlebars.js.
